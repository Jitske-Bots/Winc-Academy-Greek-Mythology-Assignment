                        <p>
                            In Greek mythology, Hector was a Trojan prince and the greatest 
                            warrior for Troy during the Trojan war. Hector led the Trojans 
                            and their allies in the defense of Troy, killing countless Greek 
                            warriors. He was ultimately killed in single combat by Achilles, 
                            who later dragged his dead body around the city of Troy behind 
                            his chariot.
                            <br><br>
                            Hector was described by the chronicler Malalas in his account of 
                            the Chronography as "dark-skinned, tall, very stoutly built, 
                            strong, good nose, wooly-haired, good beard, squinting, speech 
                            defect, noble, fearsome warrior, deep-voiced". Meanwhile, in the 
                            account of Dares the Phrygian, he was illustrated as ". . spoke 
                            with a slight lisp. His complexion was fair, his hair curly. 
                            His eyes would blink attractively. His movements were swift. 
                            His face, with its beard, was noble. He was handsome, fierce, 
                            and high-spirited, merciful to the citizens, and deserving of 
                            love."
