                            Poseidon; Greek: Ποσειδῶν) was one of the Twelve Olympians in ancient 
                            Greek religion and myth, god of the sea, storms, earthquakes and horses. 
                            In pre-Olympian Bronze Age Greece, he was venerated as a chief deity at 
                            Pylos and Thebes. He also had the cult title "earth shaker". In the myths 
                            of isolated Arcadia he is related with Demeter and Persephone and he was 
                            venerated as a horse, however it seems that he was originally a god of 
                            the waters. He is often regarded as the tamer or father of horses, and 
                            with a strike of his trident, he created springs which are related to 
                            the word horse. His Roman equivalent is Neptune.

                            Poseidon was the protector of seafarers, and of many Hellenic cities and 
                            colonies. Homer and Hesiod suggest that Poseidon became lord of the sea 
                            following the defeat of his father Cronus, the world was divided by lot 
                            among his three sons; Zeus was given the sky, Hades the underworld, and 
                            Poseidon the sea, with the Earth and Mount Olympus belonging to all three.
