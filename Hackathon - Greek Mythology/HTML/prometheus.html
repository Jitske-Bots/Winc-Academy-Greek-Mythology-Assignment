                            In Greek mythology, Prometheus (Ancient Greek: Προμηθεύς possibly meaning "forethought") 
                            is a Titan god of fire. Prometheus is best known for defying the gods by stealing fire 
                            from them and giving it to humanity in the form of technology, knowledge, and more 
                            generally, civilization. In some versions of the myth he is also credited with the 
                            creation of humanity from clay. Prometheus is known for his intelligence and for being 
                            a champion of humankind, and is also generally seen as the author of the human arts 
                            and sciences. He is sometimes presented as the father of Deucalion, the hero of the 
                            flood story.
                            <br><br>
                            The punishment of Prometheus as a consequence of the theft of fire and giving it to 
                            humans is a popular subject of both ancient and modern culture. Zeus, king of the 
                            Olympian gods, sentenced Prometheus to eternal torment for his transgression.
