                            Hades; Greek: ᾍδης, translit. Háidēs; Ἅιδης, Háidēs), in the ancient
                            Greek religion and myth, is the god of the dead and the king of the 
                            underworld, with which his name became synonymous. Hades was the eldest 
                            son of Cronus and Rhea, although this also made him the last son to be 
                            regurgitated by his father. He and his brothers, Zeus and Poseidon, 
                            defeated their father's generation of gods, the Titans, and claimed 
                            rulership over the cosmos. Hades received the underworld, Zeus the sky, 
                            and Poseidon the sea, with the solid earth, long the province of Gaia, 
                            available to all three concurrently. In artistic depictions, Hades is 
                            typically portrayed holding a bident and wearing his helm with Cerberus, 
                            the three-headed guard dog of the underworld, standing to his side.

                            The Etruscan god Aita and the Roman gods Dis Pater and Orcus were 
                            eventually taken as equivalent to Hades and merged into Pluto, a Latinisation 
                            of Plouton (Greek: Πλούτων, translit. Ploútōn), itself a euphemistic title 
                            often given to Hades.
