                            Ares; Ancient Greek: Ἄρης, is the Greek god of war and courage. 
                            He is one of the Twelve Olympians, and the son of Zeus and Hera. 
                            The Greeks were ambivalent toward him. He embodies the physical 
                            valor necessary for success in war but can also personify sheer 
                            brutality and bloodlust, in contrast to his sister, the armored 
                            Athena, whose martial functions include military strategy and 
                            generalship. An association with Ares endows places, objects, 
                            and other deities with a savage, dangerous, or militarized quality.
                            <br><br>
                            Although Ares' name shows his origins as Mycenaean, his reputation 
                            for savagery was thought by some to reflect his likely origins as 
                            a Thracian deity. Some cities in Greece and several in Asia Minor 
                            held annual festivals to bind and detain him as their protector. 
                            In parts of Asia Minor, he was an oracular deity. Still further 
                            away from Greece, the Scythians were said to ritually kill one 
                            in a hundred prisoners of war as an offering to their equivalent 
                            of Ares.
