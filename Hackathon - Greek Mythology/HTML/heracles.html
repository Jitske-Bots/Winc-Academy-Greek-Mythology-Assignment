                            Heracles (Greek: Ἡρακλῆς, lit. "glory/fame of Hera"), 
                            born Alcaeus (Ἀλκαῖος, Alkaios) or Alcides[2] (Ἀλκείδης, 
                            Alkeidēs), was a divine hero in Greek mythology, the son 
                            of Zeus and Alcmene, and the foster son of Amphitryon. 
                            He was a great-grandson and half-brother (as they are both 
                            sired by the god Zeus) of Perseus, and similarly a 
                            half-brother of Dionysus. He was the greatest of the Greek 
                            heroes, the ancestor of royal clans who claimed to be 
                            Heracleidae (Ἡρακλεῖδαι), and a champion of the Olympian 
                            order against chthonic monsters. In Rome and the modern 
                            West, he is known as Hercules, with whom the later Roman 
                            emperors, in particular Commodus and Maximian, often 
                            identified themselves. The Romans adopted the Greek 
                            version of his life and works essentially unchanged, 
                            but added anecdotal detail of their own, some of it 
                            linking the hero with the geography of the Central 
                            Mediterranean. Details of his cult were adapted to Rome 
                            as well.
