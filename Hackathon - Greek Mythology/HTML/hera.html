                            In ancient Greek religion, Hera; Greek: Ἥρα, translit. 
                            Hḗrā; Ἥρη, Hḗrē in Ionic and Homeric Greek) is the goddess
                            of marriage, women and family, and the protector of women 
                            during childbirth. In Greek mythology, she is queen of the 
                            twelve Olympians and Mount Olympus, sister and wife of Zeus, 
                            and daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. One of her defining 
                            characteristics in myth is her jealous and vengeful nature in 
                            dealing with any who offend her, especially Zeus' numerous 
                            adulterous lovers and illegitimate offspring.
                            <br><br>
                            Her iconography usually presents her as a dignified, matronly 
                            figure, upright or enthroned, crowned with a polos or diadem, 
                            sometimes veiled as a married woman. She is the patron goddess 
                            of lawful marriage. She presides over weddings, blesses and 
                            legalises marital unions, and protects women from harm during 
                            childbirth. Her sacred animals include the cow, cuckoo and the 
                            peacock. She is sometimes shown holding a pomegranate, as an 
                            emblem of immortality. Her Roman counterpart is Juno.
