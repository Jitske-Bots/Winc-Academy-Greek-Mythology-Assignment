                            Zeus is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, 
                            who rules as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is 
                            cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter.
                            His mythology and powers are similar, though not identical, to 
                            those of Indo-European deities such as Jupiter, Perkūnas, Perun, 
                            Indra, Dyaus, and Zojz. 
                            <br><br>
                            Zeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea, the 
                            youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the 
                            eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus's stomach. 
                            In most traditions, he is married to Hera, by whom he is usually 
                            said to have fathered Ares, Eileithyia, Hebe, and Hephaestus.
                            At the oracle of Dodona, his consort was said to be Dione, by whom 
                            the Iliad states that he fathered Aphrodite. According to the 
                            Theogony, Zeus' first wife was Metis, by whom he had Athena. 
                            Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. These resulted in 
                            many divine and heroic offspring, including Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, 
                            Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, Minos, 
                            and the Muses.
