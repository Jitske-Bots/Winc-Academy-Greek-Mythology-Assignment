                            In Greek mythology, Perseus (Greek: Περσεύς, translit. Perseús) 
                            is the legendary founder of Mycenae and of the Perseid dynasty. 
                            He was, alongside Cadmus and Bellerophon, the greatest Greek 
                            hero and slayer of monsters before the days of Heracles. 
                            He beheaded the Gorgon Medusa for Polydectes and saved Andromeda 
                            from the sea monster Cetus. He was the son of Zeus and the mortal 
                            Danaë, as well as the half-brother and great-grandfather of 
                            Heracles (as they were both children of Zeus, and Heracles' mother 
                            was descended from Perseus).
                            <br><br>
                            Because of the obscurity of the name "Perseus" and the legendary 
                            character of its bearer, most etymologists presume that it might 
                            be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus's native city was Greek 
                            and so were the names of his wife and relatives. There is some idea 
                            that it descended into Greek from the Proto-Indo-European language. 
                            In that regard Robert Graves has proposed the only Greek derivation 
                            available. Perseus might be from the Greek verb πέρθειν (pérthein, 
                            "to waste, ravage, sack, destroy") some form of which appears in 
                            Homeric epithets.
