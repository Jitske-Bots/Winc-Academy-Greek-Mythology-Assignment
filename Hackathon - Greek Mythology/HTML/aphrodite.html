                            Aphrodite; Ancient Greek: Ἀφροδίτη, romanized: Aphrodítē; Attic Greek 
                            is an ancient Greek goddess associated with love, lust, beauty, pleasure, 
                            passion, and procreation. She was syncretized with the Roman goddess Venus. 
                            Aphrodite's major symbols include myrtles, roses, doves, sparrows, and swans.

                            The cult of Aphrodite was largely derived from that of the Phoenician goddess 
                            Astarte, a cognate of the East Semitic goddess Ishtar, whose cult was based on 
                            the Sumerian cult of Inanna. Aphrodite's main cult centers were Cythera, Cyprus, 
                            Corinth, and Athens. Her main festival was the Aphrodisia, which was celebrated 
                            annually in midsummer. In Laconia, Aphrodite was worshipped as a warrior goddess. 
                            She was also the patron goddess of prostitutes, an association which led early 
                            scholars to propose the concept of "sacred prostitution" in Greco-Roman culture, 
                            an idea which is now generally seen as erroneous.
